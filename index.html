    <h1>Safecast Measurement Count</h1>

    <div>
      Include 'safecast_measurement_count.js' and create a div with an id of 'safecast_measurement_count'.  When the page is loaded, the javascript will insert the measurement count into the div.
      <br />
      <br />
      This should work with both div's and span's.
